### Welcome!

Hi! I am postdoctoral researcher at UCLA working in the field of very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy. My research primarily focuses on active galactic nuclei (AGNs), TeV halos, high-energy neutrinos and astronomical instrumentation. I am a member of the VERITAS and CTA Collaborations.

I received my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), master degree in Planetary Science at the same University, and went on to earn my Ph.D. in Physics from The University of Alabama in 2017.
