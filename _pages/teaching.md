## Teaching


I have experience teaching PH105(General Physics I​, lab), PH106(General Physics II, lab) and AY 102 (Introductory Astronomy) and was involved in developing course content, assessments, lab set up and grading quizzes and exams. I am prepared to teach general physics courses to majors and non-majors at the undergraduate and master’s degree level.
